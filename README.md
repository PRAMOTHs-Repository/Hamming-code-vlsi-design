#VLSI Design of Hamming Code Algorithm
Introduction

In modern data communication systems, ensuring the integrity of transmitted data is crucial. The Hamming Code Algorithm provides a reliable method for error detection and correction, especially in environments prone to data corruption, such as electronic circuits deployed in critical industries like nuclear power plants.

Methodology

The Hamming Code Algorithm can detect up to 2-bit errors and correct single-bit errors by utilizing extra parity bits. This project focuses on the VLSI implementation of the Hamming Code Algorithm, aiming to enhance the reliability of data transmission in electronic circuits.
Calculation of Hamming Code

    Identify Positions of Parity Bits: Parity bits are inserted into specific bit positions, marked as P1, P2, P4, and P8, based on their powers of 2.
    Calculate Position Bits: Parity bits are calculated using predefined patterns, such as even or odd parity, to detect errors in transmitted data.
    Final Data (Data + Parity Bits): The original data is combined with the calculated parity bits to form the final transmitted data.

Error Detection

After receiving the transmitted data, error detection is performed by analyzing the parity bits. This allows for the identification of errors and enables corrective measures to be taken based on the parity bit patterns.
